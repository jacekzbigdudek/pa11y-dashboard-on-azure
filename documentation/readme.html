      <h3>Instructions for how to deploy pa11y-dashboard to an Azure subscription.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
        Open a powershell window.
        </li>

        <li>
        Clone project repository to local machine: <span class="command">git clone &lturl-to-project-repository&gt</span>
        </li>

        <li>
        Download and install the <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/>Azure CLI tool</a>. 
        </li>

        <li>
        Download the <a href=https://www.terraform.io/downloads>Terraform binary</a>. 
        </li>

        <li>
        Log into your Azure account using CLI: <span class="command">az login</span>
        </li>

        <li>
        Set current subscription for the account that was logged into: 
            az account set --subscription "&lsaquo subscription-id&rsaquo"
        </li>

        <li>
        Create a service principal and save credential information to a file for use in next step: <span class="command"> az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/&lsaquosubscription-id&rsaquo" &rsaquo credentials.ps1 </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        Set environment variables to hold credentials:
        Save the service principal credentials information to file as per step.
        Then edit the file into a powershell script. Run in powershell session to set environment variables. 
            
        There are other ways of having terraform.exe (and packer?) authenticate itself, but Hashicorp recommends using environment variables to hold the service principal credentials.
        </li>

        <li>
        Run terraform apply in main project directory.
        </li>

      </ol>

Some To Dos:
============
Internalize and systematize (to a reasonable extent) the process of setting up an SSH connection to VM(s) created by your IaC project.
    (a) Creating public-private key pairs.
    (b) Passing public key to IaC deployment as argument.
    (c) Setting up cloud networking components that enables SSH connections.
    (c) Storing private key on our home/work computers.

Documentation:
==============

Service description
    Overview of how to deploy and manage pa11y-dashboard 
    You can have a collection of tasks with a dependency graph.
In detail
    Project repository
        Potential future branches (VM scale set, kubernetes implementations)
        Latest executables will be contained directly in the repo for now?
    Azure account 
        Azure cloud account
        Downloading and using Azure CLI command line tool
        Defining subscription, resource group, security principal
        Use the notes above for some of this.
    Terraform
        Terraform executables and preliminaries
            Downloading provider extensions
            Setting up environment variables for access to azure account.
            Basic commands for deploying a terraform project
        Resource types that you need permissions to create in azure account.
        Basic semantics of main.tf file
        How to provide parameters for terraform deployment.
            machine name
            admin user name and public ssh key
            desired DNS domain name for the machine? or at least a suffix.
            any paramaters we may want to use to pre-configure pa11y-dashboard
        Note on terraform outputs. 
            Maybe confirm the key input parameters.
            What info is needed that is not known until deployment?
        cloud-init/cloud-config
            Anything the deployer needs to know?
            Software components:
                mongodb (ver ?)
                    systemd service unit definition
                nodejs (ver ?)
                pa11y git repo
                    systemd service unit definition
                nginx or apache? or some other server running as a proxy server
                    we'll get a standard package, with service unit definition
